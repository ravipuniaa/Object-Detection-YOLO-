# Object_Dectection

Object Detection using YOLOv3 and python from picture

● Input your picture to folder instead of test2.jpg and change the code where name of picture is test2.jpg

● You should have YOLOv3.weights file, YOLOv3.cfg file and coco.names.txt file, move these files to same folder main.py of Object_Detection

YOLOv3.weight file is too big to upload file, so you have to download from this Link

There is YOLOv3.weight Download Link: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

There is YOLOv3.cfg file: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg

There is coco.names.txt file: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names
